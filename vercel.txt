To deploy this on Vercel, share/provide these:

Git repo
GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repo URL with this project pushed.
Vercel access
Either invite me to the Vercel project/team, or you deploy and I give exact settings.
Build settings (likely default)
Framework: Vite
Build command: npm run build
Output directory: dist
Environment variables (only if backend/DB is used)
Right now your app is frontend + local browser storage, so no DB is required.
If you want Neon/Postgres storage, then provide:
DATABASE_URL (pooled connection string)
Optional direct URL for migrations: DIRECT_URL
Any auth secrets (if adding login), e.g. JWT_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, etc.
Domain (optional)
Custom domain name if you want production URL on your domain.
Runtime extras (if applicable)
If adding server/API routes later: required API keys (email/SMS providers, etc.).
